**Easily assess quality control data across multiple single cell datasets**

Supercells is a tool which generates a single report for multiple 10x cellranger samples - thus saving time and allowing comparative QC analysis.

It is written in Python (tested with v3.7-3.9).

## ðŸ“¦  Installation

Clone or download the repository and navigate to the package directory, then invoke:

`pip install . `

(PyPI coming soon..)


## ðŸ’»  Usage

Once supercells is installed it is run by invoking:

`supercells -i <experiment folder>`

Unless specified otherwise it will generate `supercells_report.html` within the input folder as well as `supercells_report` folder containing the raw CSV files. To specify an output directory use the ` -o <output folder>` flag
