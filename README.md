**Easily assess quality control data across multiple single cell datasets**

Sueprcells is a tool which generates a single report for multiple 10x cellranger samples - thus saving time and allowing comparative QC analysis.

It is written in Python (tested with v3.7-3.8).

## Installation


## Usage

Once supercells is installed it is run by invoking:

`supercells -i <experiment folder>`

Unless specified otherwise it will generate `supercells_report.html` within the input folder as well as `supercells_report` folder containing the raw CSV files

## Further development
Suggestions for additional features and code contributions are welcomed
